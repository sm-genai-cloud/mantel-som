# Self-Organizing Map (SOM)

This repo contains a clean, from-scratch implementation of the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm using NumPy

## Features
- Fully vectorized, class-based SOM
- Decaying learning rate and neighborhood
- Reproducible, shuffling per epoch
- RGB-weight grid visualization

## How to Run
```bash
python run_som.py
